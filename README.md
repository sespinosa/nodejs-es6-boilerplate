# nodejs-es6-boilerplate


### Install stuff

```
npm install

```


### Run for development

```
npm run serve
```

This allows the code to be restarted on change (is using nodemon).



### Deploy 


```
npm run build
```

This will generate the `/build` directory, thats the production code.


### Test production

```
npm run production
```

This will run the code of the `/build` folder (thats the code generated after traspiling).



The es6 code should be placed on the `code` folder!
